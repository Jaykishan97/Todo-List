# TodoList
This is a simple command-line-based todo list application written in Java. It allows the user to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, view all tasks, and view completed tasks.

## Getting started
To use the TodoList application, you must have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

To run the application, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the Main.java, TodoList.java, and Task.java files. Then, compile the source code using the following command:


`javac Main.java TodoList.java Task.java`
Once the code is compiled, you can run the application using the following command:


`java Main`
This will launch the TodoList application and display a menu of options for interacting with the todo list.

## Usage
The TodoList application provides the following options:

	1. Add task: Prompts the user to enter a task name, and adds the task to the todo list.
	2. Remove task: Prompts the user to enter a task name, and removes the task from the todo list if it exists.

	4. Mark task complete: Prompts the user to enter a task name, and marks the task as complete if it exists.
	5. View completed tasks: Displays a list of all completed tasks in the todo list.
	6. Exit: Exits the application.
